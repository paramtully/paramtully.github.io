The storage of the network involved converting objects to json and storing then in the json file, and vise versa upon loading. However, the network involved bidirectional relationships which json doesn't inherently support. I solved this issue by exploiting the dependency structure to pass the parent object into children when possible. When I wasn't able to do that, I stored a hash in place of the object, and created a hash table upon loading so that those relationships could be reconstructed in amortized constant time.",
