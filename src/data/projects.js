The authentication server sends asymmetrically signed authentication tokens upon successful login which can then be stored securely in a cookie on the client’s browser. The authentication token can easily be verified by the backend with a public key, proving the sender is authorized to view their protected information. A refresh token is added to the authentication server’s response to allow user’s to get new authorization tokens when they have expired without the need to enter login credentials again.",

The biggest lesson was the need to hash and salt passwords (server-side) before storing them in databases, as it mitigates risk of attackers retrieving the user’s passwords if the database gets leaked. I also got to learn about how to mitigate risk when sending proof of authentication over the internet by using signatures with asymmetric encryption and expiry dates.",
