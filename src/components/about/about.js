                I began my academic journey pursuing a career in medicine, studying biology like 
                others in my family. But everything changed during a first-year chemistry course, 
                where I was introduced to bioinformatics and how it was transforming the field. It 
                enabled chemists to simulate reactions and accelerate discovery through software. 
                That moment sparked a deep appreciation for the power of technology and the impact 
                software engineers can have on all facets of the world.

                {/* Who am i? / how did i get into SWE (cont)*/}
                Driven by curiosity, I enrolled in a computer science course as an elective. I 
                quickly discovered both an aptitude for programming and a passion for problem-solving 
                that rivalled anything I had experienced before. This reinforced my decision to 
                redirect the trajectory of my career towards software engineering.

                I've made it a point to explore a wide breadth of CS topics to build a strong, 
                versatile foundation. I've since taken nearly every major undergraduate CS course, 
                ranging from hardware and OS and machine learning to distributed systems and DevOps.

                {/* Who am i? / how did i get into SWE (cont)*/}
                My goal has always been the same: to become the kind of engineer that can tackle any 
                challenge, across any domain.

                When I'm not working on personal projects or studying Machine Learning and AI, you can 
                find me playing basketball, at the gym, or binge watching horror movies with my family.
