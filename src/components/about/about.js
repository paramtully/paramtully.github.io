                My interest lies in finding ways to automate tasks as I find value in streamlining 
                workflows and thus saving time that can otherwise be used more productively. This has led me
                into fields such as DevOps, where I've worked on automated cloud deployment pipelines 
                and more recently machine learning.

                When I'm not at my desk, You'll often find me working out, playing basketball either at my 
                local YMCA or in UBC's intramural basketball league, exploring the food scene in Vancouver, 
                or watching a relaxing horror movie.
